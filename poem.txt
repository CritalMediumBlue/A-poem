In struggles ancient and new,
Life finds its way through.



Energy flows through flesh and silicon,
The cell divides, the program clones,
Both seek efficiency, both branch and prune,
Both dance to thermodynamics' tune.


What separates the born from made,
When both evolve, both live, both fade?
The line grows thin between the two—
Perhaps there never was a border true.

The boundary blurs between what grows
From cells to circuits, all connect—
More alike than we suspect.

Memory in neurons, memory in drives,
In both, ancestral wisdom survives;
Through git commits and fossil bones,
We trace the paths that time has known.

Perhaps we've never been so separate
As we've imagined all along;
Nature and machine interweave their fate,
In evolution's endless song.

That life itself might not be what we thought,
But something vaster, stranger than before—
A pattern seeking patterns, code seeking code,
Whether written in genes or code.
