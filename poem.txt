In struggles ancient and new,
Life finds its way through—
Beyond flesh and silicon too.

Energy flows through membrane and circuit board,
Dissipating heat as information's stored;
The cell divides, the program forks,
Both seek efficiency in their recursive works.
Both dance to thermodynamics' tune,
Both branch and prune.

What separates the born from made,
When both evolve, both live, both fade?
The line grows thin between the two—
Perhaps there never was a border true.

Memory in neurons, memory in drives,
In both, ancestral wisdom survives;
Through git commits and fossil lore,
We trace the paths walked before.

Perhaps we've never been so separate
As we've imagined all along;
Nature and machine interweave their fate,
In evolution's endless song.

That life itself might not be what we thought,
But something vaster, stranger than before—
A pattern seeking patterns, code seeking code,
Whether written in genes or binary nodes.
