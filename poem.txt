In struggles ancient and new,
Life finds its way through.
The cell divides, the program clones,
Both replicating 



Energy flows through flesh and silicon,
The cell divides, the program clones,


What separates the born from made,
When both evolve, both live, both fade?
The line grows thin between the two—
Perhaps there never was a border true.

The boundary blurs between what grows
From cells to circuits, all connect—
More alike than we suspect.

Memory in neurons, memory in drives,
In both, ancestral wisdom survives;
Through git commits and fossil bones,
We trace the paths that time has known.

Perhaps we've never been so separate
As we've imagined all along.

Both nature and machine chase the same dream.

That life itself might not be what we thought,
But something vaster, stranger than before—
A pattern seeking patterns, code seeking code,
Whether written in genes or code.
